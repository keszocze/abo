# abo Another BDD Optimization

## Installation
The following packages are needed (assuming a Ubuntu based Linux distribution)

* `cmake`
* `libboost-serialization-dev`
* `libtbb-dev`

If the documentation is being built, the following additional packages are also necessary

* `doxygen`
* `graphviz`
* `python3`
* `python3-pip`
* `sphinx` (installed with pip3)
* `sphinx_rtd_theme` (installed with pip3)

Building the documentation can be turned off by setting the cmake variable BUILD_DOCUMENTATION to OFF.
If it is being built, the resulting files are located in the build folder in docs/sphinx.

## How to reproduce the results
Build the code using cmake
* ```mkdir build && cd build```
* ```cmake ..```
* ```make```

To reproduce the results, run the script 'run_experiments.sh' in the build folder.
For each experiment, one text file in the folder 'result' will be created.
